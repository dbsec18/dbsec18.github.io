### AC Voltage and Plugs

AC power is 220 Volts, 50Hz. Plugs have three round pins in-line (the central is
ground and may be missing sometimes). Schuko (German-style) plugs are also used
but somewhat less popular. Most of the power sockets at the conference will be
able to accommodate Italian and Schuko plugs. Adapters for UK and US power plugs
are available in several electrical supply stores.

### Currency, Language

The local currency is the Euro (the symbol is â‚¬ 1 Euro ~= 1.18 US Dollars.
It comes in coins (1-2-5-10-20-50
cents, 1-2 Euros) and notes (5-10-20-50 and, less common, 100-200-500). More
info on the notes at the European Central Bank. The local language is of course
Italian.

### Telephones

#### Number formats and prefixes

Italian phone numbers have variable length, both in the "prefisso" (prefix, used
to be the area code) and in the local part of the number. The prefix must always
be included, even for local calls.

A leading "0" denotes area codes for wired phones (e.g., 035 is Bergamo, 02 is
Milan). The leading "0" is an integral part of the area code and must be dialed
also when calling from abroad.

A leading "1" is normally used for toll services or emergency numbers.

A leading "3" indicates the prefix for cellular phones (e.g., 347, 340, 338...).
They are not related to a specific area, neither, to some degree, to a specific
provider.

Toll free numbers have the "800" prefix (but they are normally free only from
landlines), whereas other prefixes starting with "8" are toll services and may
be expensive.

Finally, international calls must be prefixed by "00" and the international
prefix for the country you are calling (e.g., 001 for the US, 0044 for the UK).
The international phone prefix for Italy is 0039.

#### Emergency numbers

**112**: general emergency number

**113**: Polizia (police, general emergency)

**118**: Pronto soccorso (Emergency medical service)

**115**: Vigili del fuoco (fire brigade)

#### Calling from cell phones

Definitely the most convenient and economic way of calling abroad in most cases.
Cellular phone coverage (GSM) uses 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies, so if you have
a suitable phone you can use your regular subscription to make and receive
calls. Roaming charges are free for coutries in European Union, but very high
for other coutries (1-2 EUR per minute are not uncommon).

You can buy prepaid SIM cards (no subscription necessary) for use in your phones
in most telephony stores by just showing a picture ID (which will be photocopied
as a law requirement to identify users of SIM cards). Apart from special offers,
typical entry fees are around 10 EUR and include 5 EUR of traffic. Tariffs vary
depending on the plan you choose, most of which include a given number of SMS,
minutes of phone calls, and GB of Internet traffic. The most common cell phone
operators are Vodafone, TIM, and Wind.

#### Calling from hotels

Same as everywhere, charges for phone calls from hotels vary. Some hotels will
just apply the tariffs of the telecom operator (normally up to 10-40c connection
fee, 10 to 40c per minute for local/western Europe/US calls), other might apply
a surcharge. We suggest you to check with your hotel.

#### Calling from public phones

Public phones are rapidly vanishing these days, except in airports and train
stations. They might be coin-operated but more often will take a calling card
(on sale in some bars and tobacco shops) or sometimes a credit card (squeezing
out a fair bit of money from it, as in most places in the world).

### Banks, Credit Cards and ATM

Banks are typically open 8.30-13.00 and 15-16.30. Most of them also have ATM
machines ("bancomat"), which are open 24/7 and take most credit cards.

### Tipping and Receipts

Being a major deviation from the custom in the US, we would like to point out
that tipping is not required nor expected in Italy: the bill ("conto") always
includes service. So, in particular in bars, restaurants, taxis, etc., it is
perfectly fine to pay exactly the amount on the bill, or possibly round it up by
say 2-5% depending on the amount to make the numbers round. Italian law requires
businesses to release, spontaneously or at least on demand, a receipt with date,
sequence numbers, and identification of the business.

### Shopping

Shops are generally open Monday to Saturday, 8.00-13.00 and 15.00-20.00. Some
stores are closed on Monday morning. Others (usually electricity, hardware etc.)
are closed on Saturday afternoon. Supermarkers and department stores usually are
open 8.00-20.00 (excluding Sunday).
