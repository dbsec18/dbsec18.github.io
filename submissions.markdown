# Submissions

Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages in the LNCS format (author instructions can be found [here](http://www.springer.com/it/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)), including the bibliography and well-marked appendices.
Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without them.
Submissions are to be made to the submission web site at [www.easychair.org](http://www.easychair.org). Only pdf files will be accepted.
Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
Papers must be received by the deadline of
**TBA**.
At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full rate and must guarantee that the paper will be presented.
Note that for authors with multiple accepted papers, one full registration is valid for one paper only.
Accepted papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
The final version of the accepted papers must be in the format required of publications in the LNCS series (a Latex source file will be required).

Outstanding papers will be invited for possible publication in the Journal of Computer Security.
