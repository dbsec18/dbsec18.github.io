### Abstract

With more than 200 members, Hyperledger is one the most active 
open-source communities devoted to building decentralized ledger 
technologies. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger 
solutions, underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees 
of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is 
designed to support pluggable implementations of different components, 
and accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist across the 
blockchain ecosystem. In this talk we will focus on the Hyperledger 
Fabric design, architecture and security properties.
