### Abstract

The ubiquity of the Internet of Things brings with it new applications 
and infrastructural challenges.
Edge computing is increasingly used to reduce latency and provide 
real time capabilities in this environment. 
However, IoTs and edge computing pose a unique challenge for security
and privacy due to the sheer scale as well as the limited computational
resources available. In this talk we discuss some of the research
challenges and opportunities towards ensuring security and privacy in
this environment.
