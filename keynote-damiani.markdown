### Abstract

In the era of the Internet of Things, huge volumes of 
highly dimensional data are made available at an unprecedented velocity. 
Computations on such data include: (i) quality improvements 
(interpolation, sparsity reduction) to make them suitable for feeding 
Machine Learning  (ML) models, (ii) ML models training and tuning (iii) 
ML models' in-production operation. While much work has been devoted to 
ML privacy,  several  open challenges remain related to preserving data 
confidentiality and integrity when performing the computation of ML 
models as a- service . We present a technology-independent methodology 
for addressing CIA properties when running Artificial Intelligence 
analytics.
