## How to reach Bergamo

### Airport transportation

Arriving directly to Bergamo by plane is
certainly the easiest and probably least
expensive solution . The airport is just outside
the city. Train is also convenient. Linate and
Malpensa airports are unfortunately not well
integrated with the transportation system and if
one is not willing to use the taxi, it is better
to keep some safety margins. 


**BERGAMO AIRPORT (BGY)**

It is the main Ryanair hub in Italy, with flights to most cities served by
Ryanair. Other airlines serving Bergamo are mostly low-cost carriers, except for
Alitalia (3 flights per day connecting Bergamo with Rome, which are probably
inconvenient for those who come to Bergamo from the north) and Air
Dolomiti/Lufthansa (1 flight per day connecting Bergamo with Frankfurt). Ryanair
presents it as the 'Milano (Bergamo)' airport.

From the airport, there are local buses going to the city (line 1, every 20-30
minutes, 2.10 Euro, 10-15 minutes to reach most places in Bergamo). The bus
stops 100 meters from the conference location at Sant'Agostino (see Section on
reaching the conference location from the Bergamo train station).


**MILANO LINATE AIRPORT (LIN)**

It has frequent connections to Rome and to the main hubs of European airlines.
To reach Bergamo from Milano Linate there are these options:

<ul class="list-group">
	<li class="list-group-item">Taxi to Bergamo. It takes 40 minutes to reach Bergamo (50 Km). The cost would be around 100 Euro.</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">Taxi to the central train station in Milano, "Milano Centrale" (20 minutes, around 20 Euro), then follow the indications in <i>How to reach Bergamo from Milano Centrale train station</i>.</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">Bus to the central train station in Milano, "Milano Centrale" (20 minutes, every 20-30 minutes, 9 Euro), then follow the indications provided in <i>How to reach Bergamo from Milano Centrale train station</i>.</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">Bus '73' to the center of Milano (every 10 minutes, 25 minutes, 1.50 Euro), then underground to Milano Centrale (15 minutes, same ticket used on the bus, stamp it again when entering the underground), then follow the indications provided in <i>How to reach Bergamo from Milano Centrale train station</i>.</li>
</ul>


**MILANO MALPENSA AIRPORT (MXP)**

It is connected with many cities in Europe and to most of the
hubs of European airlines. To reach Bergamo from Milano Malpensa
there are these options:

<ul class="list-group">
	<li class="list-group-item">Taxi to Bergamo. It takes 1h20 minutes to reach Bergamo (90 Km); the cost would be relatively high (around 150-180 Euro).</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">Taxi to the central train station in Milano, "Milano Centrale" (60 minutes, around 100 Euro), then follow the indications provided in <i>How to reach Bergamo from Milano Centrale train station</i></li>
	<li class="list-group-item">"Malpensa Shuttle" bus to the central train station in Milano, "Milano Centrale" (every 20-30 minutes, 60 minutes, 10 Euro), then follow the indications provided in <i>How to reach Bergamo from Milano Centrale train station</i>.</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">"Malpensa Express" train to Milano Cadorna (every 30 minutes, 45 minutes to reach Milano Cadorna, 11 Euro), then the underground to Milano Centrale (15 minutes on the green line, 1.5 Euro), then follow the indications provided in <i>How to reach Bergamo from Milano Centrale train station</i>.</li>

### Car
Bergamo is located 50 Km East of Milano. The A4 motorway between Milano and
Bergamo has just been renovated, with 4 lanes in each direction, it is rarely
congested (whereas the motorways circling around Milan are often congested
during the day), and the trip from the eastern outskirts of Milano to Bergamo
takes 30 minutes.

Parking is quite difficult in Città Alta (it is metered in every place, with
limits on the maximum stay; many roads are closed to non-residents). It is also
not very easy in Città Bassa. There are a few parking places where the car can
be left; the rates are around 1-2 Euro per hour. Parking in Città Alta between
9am and 7pm costs 2.00€ per hour (you have to buy a ticket using coins from a
machine). Motorbikes can park freely in most places.
