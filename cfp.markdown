## Paper Submissions

Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages in the LNCS format (author
instructions can be found [here](/authors)), including the bibliography and well-marked
appendices. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and so
the paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions are to be made to
the submission web site at [easychair](http://www.easychair.org). Only pdf files will be
accepted. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without
consideration of their merits. Papers must be received by the deadline of
**TBA.**
At least one author of an accepted
paper is required to register for the conference at the full rate and must
guarantee that the paper will be presented. Note that for authors with multiple
accepted papers, one full registration is valid for one paper only. Accepted
papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series. The final version of the accepted papers must be in the format
required of publications in the LNCS series (a Latex source file will be
required).

A paper submitted to DBSec 2018 cannot be under review for any
other conference or journal during the time it is being considered for DBSec 2018.
Furthermore, after you submit to DBSec 2018, you must await our response
before submitting elsewhere. If you submit your paper to another conference or
journal either before/after submission of the paper to DBSec 2018, we will
reject your paper without review and will notify the other conference/journal
as well. This restriction applies to identical as well as to substantially
similar papers.

Outstanding papers will be invited for possible publication in the Journal of
Computer Security.
