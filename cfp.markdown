## Paper Submissions

Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages in the LNCS format,
including the bibliography and well-marked appendices. Committee
members are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper
should be intelligible without them. Submissions are to be made to the
submission web site at
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dbsec2018>. Only pdf files will
be accepted.  Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection
without consideration of their merits. Papers must be received by the
deadline of March 30, 2018 (11:59 PM American Samoa time).  At least
one author of an accepted paper is required to register for the
conference at the full rate and must guarantee that the paper will be
presented. Note that for authors with multiple accepted papers, one
full registration is valid for one paper only. Accepted papers will be
published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series. The final version of the accepted papers must be in the format
required of publications in the LNCS series (a Latex source file will
be required).  A paper submitted to DBSec 2018 cannot be under review
for any other conference or journal during the time it is being
considered for DBSec 2018. Furthermore, after you submit to DBSec
2018, you must await our response before submitting elsewhere. If you
submit your paper to another conference or journal either before/after
submission of the paper to DBSec 2018, we will reject your paper
without review and will notify the other conference/journal as
well. This restriction applies to identical as well as to
substantially similar papers.
